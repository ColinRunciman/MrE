1. This directory contains mostly Haskell programs and modules
implementing a regular-expression simplifier, and various ways of
checking, testing and measuring it.

2. Building the executables requires a host operating system classed
as "darwin", "linux" or "windows", with the ghc Haskell compiler
and libraries (version 8.6 or later) installed.

3. A Makefile specifies how to compile and run programs to obtain
test data and measured test results, filed in subdirectories.
So check that you have 'make' installed.

4. The Test program performs a basic validation check: expressions
produced as outputs by the simplifier are equivalent to those
supplied to it as inputs, and no larger.  The Test program requires
the Haskell testing package 'leancheck'.

5. To build everything, and to run all measured tests, the command

  $ make results

should (after 30-60 minutes) produce a series of tables in the
file TestResults.pdf.  Tables are generated as latex sources, so
check that you have 'pdflatex' installed.

6. The Haskell sources (*.hs) are lightly commented.  Typically a
source file contains an overall short paragraph of explanation near
the top, and some brief explanatory remarks among the declarations
of datatypes and functions.

7. For a fuller discussion of how the simplifier works, and the
results it gives, see our paper:
