* In Context.katahom, the RootCxt code could be switched on, to permit trafos not
  to do their own mirror.  But best to leave it until mirroring is memoized.
-- TO DO: coshrink X(YX)* to (Y?X)*
-- more generally: if A sublang X* and B sublang X*, coshrink AB to X*

When coShrinking Cats there is scope to do more but
the syntactic extraction could be much more expensive.  E.g.:
-- TO DO: generalise the XX* case for plural segment X
-- TO DO: use prefixCom instead of take/drop
In Presssing.sumsumePreSuf (Cat alternatives in Rep bodies):
-- TO DO: Is the use of splits instead of prefixCom here too restrictive?
-- BUT: should this really be in shrinking instead?
Concerning commuteAlternativeL and commuteAlternativeR in Pressing:
-- TO DO: this is a patch; commutes should generally have a better sense of direction,
-- determining where Cats are allowed to occur in a result
Concerning symbolFactorTrafo in Pressing:
-- TO DO: one could use groupOrder as a tool for a cleverer partition for large REs/alphabets,
-- with either basicOrd or a dedicated linear preorder
