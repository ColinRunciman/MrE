-- TO DO: coshrink X(YX)* to (Y?X)*
-- more generally: if A sublang X* and B sublang X*, coshrink AB to X*

When coShrinking Cats there is scope to do more but
the syntactic extraction could be much more expensive.  E.g.:
-- TO DO: generalise the XX* case for plural segment X
-- TO DO: use prefixCom instead of take/drop
